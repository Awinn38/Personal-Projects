                "text": "Above me, some amount of people who got more answers right on the following test (hopefully less than 100). Below me, said test along with my comments and answers sprinkled in. Behind me (mostly), worrying about the fairness and legitimacy of being eliminated from this competition by questions who&rsquo;s objective certainty can be tricky to pin down.\nQuestions 1&ndash;3 refer to the following card:\nFast Guy\nCreature &ndash; Human\n3\/1\nLifelink, haste\n1) Which color is most appropriate for this card?\n a) white\nb) blue\nc) black\nd) red\ne) green\nBlack is the only color that has pie access to both abilities.\nReference:&nbsp;http:\/\/www.wizards.com\/magic\/Magazine\/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom\/daily\/mr284\nMy answer: C\nMy feeling: Certain\n2) Which rarity is most appropriate for this card?\n a) common\nb) uncommon\nc) rare\nd) mythic rare\nThis cards is either a common or uncommon. Haste and lifelink are both black abilities, but they are secondary abilities according to the article linked below. Secondary abilities are those that show up at higher rarities or are costed less efficiently. We don&rsquo;t know the cost on the card, and I&rsquo;m not sure what we&rsquo;re supposed to assume on that except that cost is more of a development knob. Of course, as I&rsquo;m rereading that article, it&rsquo;s not exactly clear whether Mark Rosewater is working through his thoughts and process on where and how primary the abilities should be, or if we are seeing a settled discussion.\nReference: &nbsp;http:\/\/www.wizards.com\/magic\/Magazine\/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom\/daily\/mr284\nMy answer: B\nMy feeling: Uncertain\n3) You are changing one of Fast Guy&rsquo;s keywords to another one. Which of the following combinations would result in a card that could not be monocolored?\n a) first strike, haste\nb) flying, haste\nc) lifelink, shroud\nd) lifelink, vigilance\nFirst strike and haste show up in red, flying and haste in black, and lifelink and vigilance in white. Lifelink and shroud don&rsquo;t pair up anywhere.\nReference:&nbsp;http:\/\/www.wizards.com\/magic\/Magazine\/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom\/daily\/mr284\nMy answer: C\nMy feeling: Certain\nQuestions 4&ndash;6 refer to the following card:\nDeflecting Mage\nCreature &ndash; Human Wizard\n1\/4\nFlash\nWhen Deflecting Mage enters the battlefield, change the target of target spell with a single target.\n4) If this card were a hybrid card, which color pair would be most appropriate?\n a) white-black\nb) blue-red\nc) black-green\nd) red-white\ne) green-blue\nBlue and red are the only colors that regularly access the spell (not damage) redirection effect.\nReference: None. If you have a suggestion from the Rosewater catalog, I&rsquo;d be more than happy to add it in, but I didn&rsquo;t bother finding one.\nMy answer: B\nMy feeling: Certain\n5) If Design wanted to change this card&rsquo;s rules text but keep it a hybrid card, which of the following options would not work?\n a) flash; shroud\nb) double strike\nc)&nbsp;: Switch Deflecting Mage&rsquo;s power and toughness until end of turn.\nd)&nbsp;: Target player gains 2 life.\ne)&nbsp;: Target player discards a card. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.\nFlash and shroud are shared by blue and green, double strike by white and red, switching power and toughness by blue and red, life gain (non-lifelink variety) by green and white. Targeted discard belongs solely to black.\nReference: None\nMy answer: E\nMy feeling: Certain\n6) Design often makes creatures that have flash and &ldquo;enters the battlefield&rdquo; triggered abilities like Deflecting Mage. Which of the following abilities would we least likely pair with flash?\n a) Counter target spell.\nb) The next time target instant or sorcery spell would deal damage, it deals double that damage instead.\nc) CARDNAME deals 2 damage to target attacking or blocking creature.\nd) Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn.\ne) Target creature gets +3\/+3 until end of turn.\nThese least and most likely questions all operate on spectrums, so the first step in answering them is seeing if your items are spread out and easy to put in order (or even check if one item stands out in the direction your looking for), or if they&rsquo;re clumped tighter and require a more nuanced sequencing. These cards are huddled rather closely together: A-C only work at instant speed, D is pretty pointless without flash, while E is the only effect that can really stand on a non-flasher. But from another angle, every effect but B has been done on creatures before (I&rsquo;m assuming on C but that&rsquo;s irrelevant because&hellip;), but more to the point B is a clunky and unwieldy ability that only works on your own spells, so B is very unlikely to be put on a creature.\nReference: None. But I do have a thought on the relationship of these questions to design columns from . I don&rsquo;t mind if the answers come straight out of Rosewater&rsquo;s columns. I don&rsquo;t mind if they must be derived and deduced from the things he says. I don&rsquo;t even mind if some have the questions have clear source material while others do not. But I kind of mind testing my googling skills. Everything I could find an article for was either easy (because of near to exact wording) or satisfying (because I figured it out after reading something) to answer. But if I couldn&rsquo;t find an article related to a question I wasn&rsquo;t confident answering yet, especially if my lack of confidence was related to needing to know design&rsquo;s current policy on the issue, it was just frustrating. And I&rsquo;m not sure what it was testing. Given the right set of questions (which these were definitely close enough to), there should have been no problem linking to articles for each or specifying when there was no related article. And to be clear, I&rsquo;m not saying this because I wanted a higher score, I simply want to know what Wizards intends my score to reflect.\nMy answer: B\nMy feeling: Mostly certain. I don&rsquo;t think the reasoning is very solid either way. What I don&rsquo;t like about saying B is that it renders the &ldquo;pairing with flash&rdquo; part of the question a kind of red herring, because it hinges more on the awkwardness of making this one-shot effect at all. (Permanent versions of this ability are obviously fine).\nQuestions 7&ndash;9 refer to the following card:\nReturn to the &AElig;ther\nInstant\nReturn target creature you control to its owner&rsquo;s hand.\n7) Other than blue, which color is most appropriate for this card?\n a) white\nb) black\nc) red\nd) green\nWhite has self-bounce portion of pie.\nReference: None\nMy answer: A\nMy feeling: Certain\n8) Which rarity is most appropriate for this card?\n a) common\nb) uncommon\nc) rare\nd) mythic rare\nThere is nothing uncommon about the effect in white or the overall complexity of the card.\nReference: None\nMy answer: A\nMy feeling: Certain\n9) Which of the following changes are we least likely to make?\n a) Make the card a sorcery.\nb) Change &ldquo;target creature&rdquo; to &ldquo;all creatures&rdquo; and &ldquo;its owner&rsquo;s hand&rdquo; to &ldquo;their owners&rsquo; hands.&rdquo;\nc) Change &ldquo;target creature&rdquo; to &ldquo;target permanent.&rdquo;\nd) Change &ldquo;you control&rdquo; to &ldquo;an opponent controls.&rdquo;\ne) Change &ldquo;owner&rsquo;s hand&rdquo; to &ldquo;controller&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;\nAll of the other changes are reasonable, but E is the only one that could cause the card to violate the rules of the game.\nReference:  \nMy answer: E\nMy feeling: Certain\nQuestions 10&ndash;12 refer to the following card:\nMystical Fighter\nCreature &ndash; Human\n2\/2\nFirst strike\n[Mana]: Regenerate Mystical Fighter.\n10) If this card was a multicolored card, which combination of colors couldn&rsquo;t it be?\n a) white-black\nb) black-red\nc) red-green\nd) red-white\ne) green-white\nRed and white both have first strike, green and black regen. Red-white is the only pairing above that doesn&rsquo;t offer one of each.\nReference:  \nMy answer: D\nMy feeling: Certain\n11) Fâ¦",
