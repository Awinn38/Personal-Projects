        "text": "<!channel>\nHello all. Important update regarding article submissions.\n\nAs EDHREC continues to grow, so too does the workload. We’re excited things are going so well and we can hire on more people, but it also means that the normal submission guidelines are gonna change a bit.\n\nAt the moment, the deadline to submit articles is two days before the publishing date.\n\nWe’d like to change that to *one week* before the publishing date.\n\nThis is necessary for a couple reasons.\n\nFirst, with the increase in writers, the only way I’ll be able to keep up with the workload is if I’m able to edit articles with greater flexibility. The current deadline would simply take up too much time every evening. There are a handful of authors – I won’t name names - who've been a little lax with deadlines and submit an article the evening before it’s supposed to be published. I'm not upset at anyone about this, I know life is busy, I just won't be able to keep up with that when there are more writers. I got dinner plans, y’all.\n\nSecond, if folks are late on an article or will miss a submission, this gives me a better heads-up so I can make sure we have content to fill that day. At the moment, it’s a bit of a scramble to make sure we have something going out every day, so it’s much easier to adjust to unexpected stuff if we have things ready in the wings.\n\nThird – and this is important - it also means I’ll be able to push articles back to the author if there are major concerns. As the website continues to grow, we want to make sure we’re holding ourselves to a high standard. An article with serious problems – rules mistakes, incomplete decklists, structural problems, poor content, controversial subject matter, etc – will get more proper vetting, and both author and editor can have a back-and-forth to make sure the article is as good as it should be.\n\nFinally, I also want to make a change for the once-monthly writers. At the moment, our once-a-monthers aren’t fixed at a specific point every month. I try to use extra days in the month for our once-monthly writers, as well as for hole filling when someone misses a day, but this makes the articles themselves pretty inconsistent. To get things on a more reliable timetable, I’m gonna talk to the once-monthly writers to pick a specific week of each month that the articles will be due by.\n\nI’ll throw together a more specific schedule and add it to the style guide and\/or pin it here in the articles chat.\n\nNaturally this change is gonna take some time to implement, but we'd like to get it going by January. If your target publish date is on or after January 1st, I'd like those articles to be submitted a week beforehand.\n\nThanks all. Message me if you have questions.
