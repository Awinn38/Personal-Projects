May as well see if I can get 20 bucks.\" As such, you need to have your ad show up when they're online casually scrolling through stuff. I've had really good luck during both our last snow storms because people are home on their butts watching tv and fucking about on laptops or phones. I posted one last night and I've got 4 meetings set up this week to look at collections.",
