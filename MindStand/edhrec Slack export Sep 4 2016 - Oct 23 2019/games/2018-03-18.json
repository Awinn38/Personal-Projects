I played Paradox Engine with Erratic Portal out, and I had two rocks and a Doubling Cube. I walked through the steps, but didn't have enough to go infinite and exile everyone's library. I had a single Gonti cast left with some leftover and pointed at the Zacama player saying \"Well...you don't have your Sol Ring out yet, so let's roll the bones!\" \n\nI look at the top 4 and lo and behold...Sol Ring, which gave me just enough mana to get the engine going and win. Dinner was lovely, BTW.",
