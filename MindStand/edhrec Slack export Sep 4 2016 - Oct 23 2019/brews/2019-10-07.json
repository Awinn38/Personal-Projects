I have ways of using that to get card advantage, but I rarely use his eternalize ability and I usually win faster with things like paradox haze. I get a really cheap but developed zombie army that just nets me value and is a terrifying threat they can’t really deal with",

I thought it would be cute to untap gaea's cardle, and in other times is a 5\/5, but meh\n\n+ The Great Henge -- duh (it's also legendary)\n+ Rankle, Master of Prankles -- this guy is good in this deck, even self discard is not terrible, but making everyone sac a creature is good and i can get gas if i need... plus hes flying and haste\n+ Syr Konrad, the Grim -- Good in this deck. Meaty 5\/4. I guess he could fuel by milling. Could see him getting cut one day tbh if the ability isnt worth it",
