I tried it on mobile and got the same result, although I was using google chrome on both occasions.\nI figured it was a card in the deck list that was causing the problem so I kept trying half and halfs of the deck to find the culprit and it was the card \"Seance\" which has an accented e in the card title. The name \"Seance\" is accepted on tapped out, and even with the card in the list I could still get recommendations, just not see my deck. Be great if you could fix this, much appreciated.",
