It should be roughly\n```\n  const addCardButton = document.createElement('a');\n  addCardButton.setAttribute('class', 'add-card-button');\n  addCardButton.setAttribute('cardName', cardName);\n  const addCardButtonArrow = document.createElement('div');\n  addCardButtonArrow.setAttribute('class', 'glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right');\n  addCardButton.appendChild(addCardButtonArrow);\n  addCardButton.addEventListener('click', function(event) {\n    addCardToDecklist(addCardButton.getAttribute('cardName'));\n    event.preventDefault();\n  });\n\n```\nbut converted to es6+jquery\nSome context: each of these buttons used to be added while traversing through the list of card divs on the page, so cardName comes from parsing the name from what's currently shown. Not the best method but the only way to get the name when this was an extension.\nAlso, I don't see any events in the current code, and with all of the elements being added as strings I don't think my current method of adding an event listener will work. It's possible that you could create this as a separate function, and give each button an onclick to call that function instead.\nI haven't been able to think of a better way to tell which card the button is being pressed on and pass that info to the addCardToDecklist function, but if you think of any please let me know. To test if this works, the card should be visible by clicking decklist after clicking the add card button.\nLet me know if you make it a let or if you manage to easily get the changes in :slightly_smiling_face:",
