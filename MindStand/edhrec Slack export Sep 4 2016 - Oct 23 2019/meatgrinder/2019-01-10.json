If this is true, this doesn't lend itself well to modification in the future on your end, as there will be two definitions of the function and only the one in my repo will work. If your intent was to copy\/merge in my modifications to the file manually, then the only thing I'm unsure of is how to test that this works",

        "text": "One more thing - when you can, I need some changes to be made to json_dict\n- `commander` should be included as a top level value in json_dict (so as not to interfere with render_cardview) with the same schema as any of the cards in the cardlists. This is so that I can pull pricing and type data for the commander of a given page when a user adds it to their decklist\n- Each card should include a `type` property. One of the decklist requirements is to display cards broken down by type, but if a user adds a card from `Top Cards` or `Signature Cards` or even the commander for a given page, I currently don't know which type the card is so I cannot categorize it",
