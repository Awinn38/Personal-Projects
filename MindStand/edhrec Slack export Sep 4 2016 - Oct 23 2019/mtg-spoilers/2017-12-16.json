Lifting those boulders was less impressive than even lifting an xwing from a swamp. She had an impressive fight with Kylo in this movie where she showed a lot of force prowess, but this came after a significant amount of training. The most unprecedented thing Rey did was in the last movie she had mind powers. However, there isn't a lot of precedent set to show mind trick difficulty.\n\nA mary sue has to shoe to be flawless or to be the ultimate savior of any situation. She is shown to be competent in difficult situations, but she doesn't effortlessly save the day in any situation. She shows up to move a few rocks, and in ep7 she fights off an already half defeated kylo with a blaster wound that should have killed him. She is continually shown as a character with issues with self awareness and aloof social skills. These are not the traits typical of a mary sue. \n\nAnd simply put, the amount of force Leia needed to pull herself back to the ship in a vacuum is really small. \n\nRey does needed more character progression in both movies and they haven't shown enough struggle in her scenes, but she is not a mary sue. These problems are more plot issues than anything.\n\nTldr; Rey doesn't do anything unprecedented and has interesting flaws so she's not a mary sue.",

And I would like to know how she just suddenly knew \"oh hey, I can tell people what to do and they just do it!\" I can understand how she naturally can resist kylo reading her mind, but knowing specifics like she does seemed like a bit of a leap for someone who thought Jedi were a myth. Maybe if they talked about a certain story of \"one time Luke did this...\" would have even covered it. But yea, I can see where you're coming from rick. ",
