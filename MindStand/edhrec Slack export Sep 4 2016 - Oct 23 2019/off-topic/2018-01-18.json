Sorry H.P.!\n\nLyrics:\n\nThro’ the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber,\nPast the wan-moon’d abysses of night,\nI have liv’d o’er my lives without number,\nI have sounded all things with my sight;\nAnd I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness with fright.\n\n I have whirl’d with the earth at the dawning,\nWhen the sky was a vaporous flame:\nI have seen the dark universe yawning,\nWhere the black planets roll without aim;\nWhere they roll in their horror unheeded, without knowledge or lustre or name.\n\nI had drifted o’er seas without ending,\nUnder sinister grey-clouded skies\nThat the many-fork’d lightning is rending,\nThat resound with hysterical cries;\nWith the moans of invisible daemons that out of the green waters rise.\n\nI have plung’d like a deer thro’ the arches\nOf the hoary primoridal grove,\nWhere the oaks feel the presence that marches\nAnd stalks on where no spirit dares rove;\n\nI have stumbled by cave-ridden mountains\nThat rise barren and bleak from the plain,\nI have drunk of the fog-foetid fountains\nThat ooze down to the marsh and the main;And in hot cursed tarns I have seen things I care not to gaze on again.\n\nI have scann’d the vast ivy-clad palace,\nI have trod its untenanted hall,\nWhere the moon writhing up from the valleys\nShews the tapestried things on the wall;\nStrange figures discordantly woven, which I cannot endure to recall.\n\n I have peer’d from the casement in wonder\n At the mouldering meadows around,\n At the many-roof’d village laid under\n The curse of a grave-girdled ground;\n\nI have haunted the tombs of the ages,\nI have flown on the pinions of fear\nWhere the smoke-belching Erebus rages,\nWhere the jokulls loom snow-clad and drear:\nAnd in realms where the sun of the desert consumes what it never can cheer.\n\n I was old when the Pharaohs first mounted\n  The jewel-deck’d throne by the Nile;\n I was old in those epochs uncounted\n When I, and I only, was vile;\n\nOh, great was the sin of my spirit,\nAnd great is the reach of its doom;\nNot the pity of Heaven can cheer it,\nNor can respite be found in the tomb:\nDown the infinite aeons come beating the wings of unmerciful gloom.\n\nThro’ the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber,\nPast the wan-moon’d abysses of night,\nI have liv’d o’er my lives without number,\nI have sounded all things with my sight;\nAnd I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness with fright.",
