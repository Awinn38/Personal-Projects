        "text": "Been struggling lately, Dani has been getting frustrated with her job to the point of talking about giving in her two weeks. She's a CDC worker and she just got a promotion to the lead of a couple of rooms. She's loved the job for two years, it puts her degree in early childhood education to use and she's a great worker. But the place has blatantly been taking advantage of her, always giving her hours she hates and tells them she hates because the rest of the building seems to have no issues with just calling out or demanding other hours or they'll quit and the management is weak, at best, with dealing with these kinds of things. She was hoping to switch to an earlier shift with the promotion, as none of the other leads close unless they want to and she found out last week she won't be changing at all. She works 9-6, but closing is more like 6:30 and it means she barely sees the older two boys... They're typically gone with me in the morning to their school center before she's awake and they go to bed at 8, so she gets maybe an hour and a half with them.",
