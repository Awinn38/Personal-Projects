As new sets get released and such, that gives us new topics too, which affects any schedule and our choice of topics. \n\nWe want to get to everyone eventually, we just also want to do right by the folks who have been here writing articles the longest and who were very close to actually being podcast hosts themselves (since we did a kind of audition thing when the cast was getting underway).\n\nSo for your specific question, no, at this point it’s a little tough to plan too far in advance. Even the fact that we often record shows a week in advance has sometimes thrown off our schedule. \n\nThere’s a finite number of us. It’s a matter of when, not if.",
