    "I believe that the idea of STEM should remain as it is currently with the arts and STEM remaining separate. As someone with a great appreciation for the art where the arts are what inspired me to become an engineer. It may be a dated perspective from my experience in the arts, it has served a purpose of allowing people to be able to understand and express who we are and our humanity. It is a exploration of the self and contemporary times that are ever chaning and subjective to the lives of the individuals of which the art comes from which allows a even greater understanding of what it is like and will be like to be human.\n",

    "In respect to STEM my understanding has been that these serve more as tools for humanity to use to understand how the world works. while there is a probably is an epistemological debate to be had on how we decide what is worth focusing on in STEM and how this may be shaped and influenced by the arts that we experience I feel that these tools that we are taught in STEM shoudld be intentionally separated from the contemporary beliefs and ideals that the arts often live under. \n",

This video in particular focuses on how a museum was built around a cave that contained cave art from 17,000 years ago and the efforts that were made to preserve the cave. I feel this youtube channel and video subject complement the use of STEM principle and discoveries while inspiring a respect and appreciation for not just the art in the video but how art has been important to us long before STEM.
